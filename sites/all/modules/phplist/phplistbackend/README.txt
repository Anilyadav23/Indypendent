Installation of PHPlistbackend
------------------------------

Enable the module as per any other module and then edit the content types that you wish to send via PHPlist.  You'll see an extra 
option in the "Publishing Options" tab to "send as newsletter".  Once checked, new content of this type will have extra fields to
allow it to be used as the source of PHPlist messages.
